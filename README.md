## Overview of Project:
We would like to know the trend and details of fundraisers in relation to their launch dates and funding goals to compare to the client's own fundraiser for her play.

## Analysis and Chanllenges
### Initial Analysis In order to perform this analysis, I decided to dive into the data and create some columns; year of the deadline, time between start date and deadline, average of the outcome, and outcome vs goal (in $).

### Deep-Dive Analysis
Once the initial analysis was done, it was indicated to dive into the theater category (since the client fundraiser relates to play).  We decide to analyze the outcomes of theater fundraiser by Launch Date.

Then we sliced the data to concentrate on the plays only (Subcategory=plays) represents 77% of all theater values.

We decide to look at the outcomes of the plays fundraisers based on their goals. 

No challenges were encountered performing the analysis but there could have been some issues in the slicing and counting with criteria (outcome criteria and revenue category criteria).

## Results
### Result 1. On the Theater outcomes by Launch Date, we can see that there were barely any canceled fundraisers or they account for a minimal % of all theater fundraisers. The concentration of successful fundraisers were between May and July and the lower successes in November, December, and January.

### Result 2. On the Outcomes based on goals, we can see that none of the plays fundraisers were canceled but the fail % seems high enough that it should be looked further into. It would be interesting to detail the outcomes based on goals in opposition to the months (see result 1). The most successful fundraisers in plays were the ones where the goals were less than 5,000 and more than 35,000. To be noted that there were only a few fundraisers above 35,000. 

## Furthermore
This dataset could be defined as limited as it would be interesting to see how many participants each fundraisers had and the min/max/average donation to each fundraiser. We can make assumptions that for the larger (by goal) fundraiser, more people would have been included in the initial launch in order to meet the high goal. 
We are missing some characteristics for each fundraiser in order to make not only assumptions but add certainty.
